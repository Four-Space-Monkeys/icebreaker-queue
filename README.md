### Current Features
- Users join queues based on their selected interests
- A match is made once two users exist in a queue â€“ the application generates an agora channel and token, and the socket emits the room information to the client
### What's Next
- Prevent a match between users who have already been on a call before
- Use a more complex algorithm to maximize matches
